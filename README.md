# VimSesh

The goal of VimSesh is to have a fast light-weight *IDE* in the CLI.

# Requirements
* **Ripgrep** - for Telescope (you need this for fuzzy find, aka. search throughout the opened project)
* **Neovim** > 0.10
* **WSL** - *Windows users* - please use WSL if you use windwos, it will just make your life 10 times easier 

# Key binds

See *lua/core/mappings.lua*. I will add them here when I am satisfied with the keybinds.
